## History
Saviors/Tesseract/Eclipse was one of the most controversial clans on 6b6t. Originally it was named "New Revolution" but it changed its name many times.

New Revolution was founded by DataDrop, patosogamer, and PollyNeedCrack. The "New Revolution" was soon rebranded to "Tesseract", PollyNeedCrack was the owner of the discord server but then transferred it to patosogamer and then left/got kicked out due to internal issues. PollyNeedCrack then went on to leak multiple bases/stashes to [scarthebest1943](../Players/scar.md) so he could grief them.

Players from across the community, 555 members and members of the later-formed group [104](./104.md), expressed disapproval towards Tesseract, which ultimately led Advik555 to inside and grief it.

scarthebest1943 then made [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI5ZHRTy6kk) after griefing Tesseract's main base and stash which also exposed the concerning behaviors of members like KeprisNexus

for the next month Advik555 continued to inside Tesseract and grief their bases. Tesseract's discord server was then nuked in a combined effort of advik555 and [104](./104.md). Scar then made [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfk33GHCQKU) which again showed tesseract owners using mischevious practices to make things go their way.

By this time Tesseract leaders and members were fed up with [555](./555) and [104](./104) griefing them constantly and giving them bad publicity so they rebranded to Eclipse, which also ended up being griefed in just over a month with scar making [yet another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cweJk6zupDY)

Eclipse then went back to their previous name (Tesseract). They were once again griefed through KeprisNexus' accounts. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YORdPtE0aN0) was then uploaded by scar

After just under a month the Tesseract discord got nuked and their bases were griefed. Scar uploaded [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5GKXLeJRis) on it 

Tesseract then rebranded to Saviors

Saviors was at its peak around late 2024, there was an influx of players around November 2024 with many projects underway. That was until the 18th of December, where [104](./104) went on a griefing rampage, griefing 7 bases and stashes. This included the Saviors Christmas Base that was being built for the Christmas competition. However, Saviors was not affected by this. Saviors then griefed 2 [555](./555.md) bases. 

Saviors was building a very large spawn logo. When 555 members came to know about this they griefed the logo. THM (The Highway Men) and 104 also helped griefing

Saviors continued to do well, however, [iced_cave](../Players/iced_cave.md) (the owner) was becoming less and less active, leading to many internal issues.
Then, on the 8th of March of 2025 every saviors base was griefed by 555 and 104. It is still unknown how this happened but many point towards one or more of the council higher members being an insider. The saviors discord was then deleted and the private discord was made public by 555 and [Aitana](../Players/etienne200296.md). According to [wavybody](../Players/wavybody.md), Vertrica08 sold spacevalkyria v2, the main stash, the delivery stash, the recruit base, the counsil base and the medieval base to fourseven
