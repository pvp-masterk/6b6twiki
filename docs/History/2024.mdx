## qbasty wants to leave
[qbasty](../Players/qbasty.md) made the following announcement:
> 6b6t is for sale. I have been thinking about this for a while and it's time for me to work on something else. I've been running anarchy servers since 2021. I have still many great ideas to take this server to thousands of players and long lifetime so it doesn't shut down, but I believe I'm not gonna be the one to take it there. I would love to help someone take the server there by still being involved few days per month. Please DM me with your offers, I won't give you the price so just tell me your best price at the start, be serious, I'm sure I'll receive **a lot** of requests, 6b6t is not only the biggest anarchy server in the world, it's also the one that generates the most revenue after 2b2t (not profit, because we reinvest everything and put in additionally our own money, it's possible for the server to be profitable but we chose growth and updates instead of profit).
> I'll sell the server to the person that not offers just the most, but is also the best person to take over.
> My DMs are open. I'll make sure the server continues running and you can still have fun, so no worries. ❤️ 👑 Have a nice day everyone.

In this announcement he stated that he wants to work on something else and that he will make sure that the server keeps running.

## 10/12/2024
6b6t was not sold, and made a return on October 12th of 2024, as many Turkish players started joining the server. The server returned with the publishing of a youtube video titled [We Are Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-yqxRJDd4c). This video teased and announced new features and changes for the server, as well as 12 dupes being added, resulting in it getting over a thousand views in less than a week.

## 10/31/2024
On October 31st of 2024, [scarthebest1943](../Players/scar.md) would upload a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXG5GppQag4) leaking one of the 12 dupes added to the server. It would gain immense popularity, but the dupe would unfortunately get patched the same day.

## 10/31/2024
Just 4 hours after the first dupe was leaked and patched, [scarthebest1943](../Players/scar.md) would upload a new [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUdl7p97kpQ), leaking the second dupe in 6b6t. This video also immediately gained immense popularity, however like before, Xymb was quick to patch it.

## 11/01/24
The next day, [scarthebest1943](../Players/scar.md) uploaded a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5o7noV-_pg) leaking a second variant of the egg dupe seen in the previous video. This dupe would also get patched an hour later.

## 11/01/24
[scarthebest1943](../Players/scar.md) would upload a video titled ["Cactus #dupe leak x4"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4shkjJxtPo), showcasing a dupe where you would drop a shulker onto the top of a cactus, leading the cactus to break and the shulker to dupe. It gained 400 views in just one day alone, and was the easiest dupe to date. 15gg_ would also release a video showcasing this dupe titled ["6b6t Cactus #dupe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waFKy92R7vs). This dupe was patched the next day.

## 11/02/24
[scarthebest1943](../Players/scar.md) would upload the last video to-date titled ["6b6t #dupe leak x5"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgY0-I6XdsI). This video showcased a duplication bug where you would put two pistons facing each other, while one had two observers behind it. Placing a shulker in between these two pistons would cause it to dupe. 15gg_ also uploaded a video about this dupe titled ["6b6t Observer #dupe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE-V23OJMtE). During this time, the clan known as Tesseract would get griefed by [104](../Groups/104.md), as well as have it's Discord server nuked.
